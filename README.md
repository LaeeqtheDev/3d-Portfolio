# 🌐 3D Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my immersive 3D developer portfolio — a dynamic, visually-rich site built with **React Three Fiber**, **Three.js**, and **GSAP**. This project transforms a traditional portfolio into an interactive WebGL experience, showcasing both technical skill and design finesse.

Live Demo: [Coming Soon]  
Portfolio: [https://laeeqthedevportfolio.vercel.app](https://laeeqthedevportfolio.vercel.app)

## 🚀 Overview

The 3D Portfolio is designed to make a lasting impression by blending smooth animation, interactive 3D elements, and responsive UI into a seamless storytelling experience.

Whether you're a recruiter or dev peer, this portfolio demonstrates expertise in:
- Component-based architecture
- WebGL rendering
- Creative animation pipelines
- Advanced front-end tooling

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 **React Three Fiber Integration**  
  Leverages `@react-three/fiber` to render performant 3D elements in the browser.

- 🌠 **Scroll-Triggered Animations**  
  Smooth transitions and camera shifts powered by `GSAP` and `Framer Motion`.

- 🧭 **Modular Sections**  
  Each section (Intro, About, Projects, Contact) is its own scrollable 3D scene.

- 📱 **Fully Responsive Design**  
  Tailored for all screens — from desktops to tablets and smartphones.

- ⚙️ **Optimized Performance**  
  Lazy-loading assets, minimal bundle size, and smart camera frustum culling.
