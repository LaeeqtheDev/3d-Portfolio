# 3D Portfolio – Immersive Developer Website

This is a fully interactive 3D developer portfolio designed to make a bold impression. Built using React Three Fiber, Three.js, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS, this project turns a standard portfolio into a cinematic experience — scroll-driven, animated, and smooth across devices.

---

## Overview

The 3D Portfolio features real-time WebGL scenes rendered in the browser, with seamless transitions between sections like Introduction, About Me, Projects, and Contact.

Using GSAP and React Three Fiber, the camera glides through immersive scenes while content appears dynamically — giving viewers a unique, animated journey through your work.

---

## Features

* Real-time 3D rendering using React Three Fiber and Three.js
* Scroll-triggered animations with GSAP and Framer Motion
* Clean, component-based architecture
* Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
* Lazy loading for 3D assets and optimized performance
* Modular scenes and easily extendable sections

## Project Structure

* `public/` – Static assets including 3D models and textures
* `src/components/` – Reusable 3D and UI components
* `src/scenes/` – Individual sections of the portfolio (like Intro, Projects, etc.)
* `src/styles/` – Tailwind configuration and global styles
* `App.jsx` – Main app layout and canvas logic
* `main.jsx` – Application entry point

## Customization Tips

* Replace any 3D assets by uploading `.glb` or `.gltf` files into the `public/models` folder
* Update lighting, camera behavior, and animations in each `src/scenes` file
* Add new sections by creating new scenes and updating the scroll logic
* Update styles in `tailwind.config.js` to match your personal branding
